# Introduction

It's the backend system of Rapid Platform

## How to start

- `npm start`

#Prerequisite

- Create `public/docs` directory on this project (it needs to have `R/W/E` permission) `OR`
- Copy ./src/example/docs file to ./public/docs -- for directly seeing the documents we have

## TODO

- Synchronization issue: Need to update on `singleton pattern` of querying/updating `index.json`
- If same file name is given for different pages it will get replace
